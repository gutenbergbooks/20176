<h3><i>A COMEDY IN THREE ACTS</i></h3>

<h2>ACT I.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The farm kitchen of John Murray. It is large
and spacious, with a wide open fire-place to the right. At
the back is one door leading to the parlour and other rooms
in the house, also a large window overlooking the yard outside.
To the left of this window is the door leading into
the yard, and near the door an old-fashioned grandfather's
clock. Opposite to the fire-place on the left side is another
door leading into Daniel Murray's workshop, and beside
this door is a large dresser with crockery, &amp;c. At the
back beneath the window is a table near which</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>, <i>the
servant, a slatternly dressed girl of some thirty years of
age or more, is seated. She is carefully examining some
cakes of soda bread, and has a bucket beside her into which
she throws the rejected pieces.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. That one's stale. It would break your teeth
to eat it. (<i>She throws the cake into the bucket.</i>) And the
mice have nibbled that one. And there's another as
bad. (<i>She throws both pieces into the bucket.</i>)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Brown</span>, <i>the servant man, opens the door from yard and
enters. He is elderly, and with a pessimistic expression
of face, relieved somewhat by the sly humour that is
in his eyes. He walks slowly to the centre of the
kitchen, looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>, <i>and then turns his eyes, with
a disgusted shake of the head, towards the dresser as if
searching for something.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well! Well! Pigs get fat and men get
lean in this house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. It's you again, is it? And what are you looking
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I'm looking a spanner for the boss. The
feedboard to the threshing machine got jammed just
when halfway through the first stack, and he is in a
lamentable temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). Is he? (<i>She starts hurriedly to clear
up the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>watching her slyly to see what effect his words
have</i>). And he's been grumbling all morning about the
way things is going on in this house. Bread and things
wasted and destroyed altogether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Well, it's all Miss Mary's fault. I told her
about this bread yesterday forenoon, and she never
took any heed to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Miss Mary? (<i>With a deprecatory shake of
his head.</i>) What does a slip of a girl like that know
about housekeeping and her not home a half-year yet
from the boarding-school in the big town, and with no
mother nor nobody to train her. (<i>He stares in a puzzled
way at the dresser.</i>) I don't see that spanner at all. Did
you see it, Kate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. No. I've more to do than look for spanners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>gazing reproachfully at her and then shaking
his head</i>). It's a nice house, right enough. (<i>Lowering his
voice.</i>) And I suppose old Mr. Dan is never up yet.
I was told by Johnny McAndless, he was terribly full
last night at McArn's publichouse and talking&mdash;ach&mdash;the
greatest blethers about this new invention of his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Do you say so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Aye. No wonder he's taking a lie this morning.
(<i>He peeps into the door of the workshop.</i>) He's not
in his wee workshop?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. No. Miss Mary is just after taking up his
breakfast to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Some people get living easy in this world.
(<i>He gives a last look at the dresser.</i>) Well divil a spanner
can I see. I'll tell the master that. (<i>He goes out again
through the yard door, and as he does so,</i> <span class="smcap">Mary Murray</span>
<i>comes through the door from the inner rooms, carrying a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
tray with teacups, &amp;c., on it. She is a pretty, vivacious
girl about eighteen years of age.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. It's the servant man looking for a spanner for
your father, Miss Mary. There's something gone wrong
with the threshing machine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>taking the tray to the table and starting to get
ready to wash up the cups</i>). I do believe sometimes that
Uncle Dan's a lazy man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>assisting her at the washing and stopping as if
astonished at the statement</i>). And is it only now you're
after finding that out! Sure the whole countryside
knowed it this years and years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>sharply</i>). The whole countryside has no business
to talk about what doesn't concern it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Oh, well, people are bound to talk, Miss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. But then Uncle Dan is awfully clever. He's
got the whole brains of the Murrays, so father says,
and then, besides that, he is a grand talker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Aye. He can talk plenty. Sure Sarah McMinn,
that lives up the Cut, says its a shame the way he's going
on this twenty years and more, never doing a hand's
turn from morning to night, and she says she wonders
your poor father stands him and his nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Who said that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Sarah McMinn told Johnny McAndless that
yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Sarah McMinn? Pooh! That hard, mean,
old thing. No. I believe in Uncle Dan and so does
father. He'll make a name for himself yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Well, it's getting near time he done it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. And that Sarah McMinn they say just keeps her
brother in starvation, and she just says nasty things like
that about Uncle Dan because he doesn't like her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Aye. He never did like people as seen through
him, not but she is a mean old skin-a-louse. (<i>The voice
of</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel Murray</span> <i>is heard calling from within.</i>) He's
up, Miss.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Are you up, uncle?</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dan Murray</span> <i>opens the door from the inner apartments
and comes into the kitchen. He is carelessly dressed
and sleepy-looking as if just out of bed, wears a muffler
and glasses, and appears to be some fifty years of age.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Yes. Did the <i>Whig</i> come yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Yes. I put it in your workshop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>glancing at the clock</i>). Bless my heart, it's
half-past one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>). It is, indeed, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well! Well! Time goes round, Mary. Time
goes round. (<i>Kate picks up the bucket and goes out by
the yard door.</i>) Where's your father? (<i>He crosses over
to the workshop door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. He's out working with Sam Brown at the
threshing all morning since seven o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well! Well! A very industrious man is
John Murray. Very. But lacking in brains, my dear&mdash;lacking
in brains. Kind, good-hearted, easy-going, but&mdash;ah!
well, one can't help these things. (<i>He goes towards
the workshop.</i>) Where did you say the <i>Whig</i> was, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. It's in your workshop. (<i>He crosses over to go
there.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. You were very late coming in last night, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Eh? (<i>He goes in, gets the paper, comes out
again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. I heard you coming in, and the clock was just
after striking two. (<i>He sits down and opens paper.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well&mdash;I met a few friends last night. Appreciative
friends I could talk to, and I was explaining that
new idea of mine that I've been working at so long&mdash;that
new idea for a fan-bellows. It's a great thing. Oh yes.
It should be. I sat up quite a while last night, thinking
it over, and I believe I've got more ideas about it&mdash;better
ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Do you think you'll make money off it, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Mary&mdash;if it comes off&mdash;if I can get someone
to take it up, I believe 'twill make our fortune, I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Oh, uncle, it would be lovely if you did, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
I would just die to see that nasty McMinn woman's
face when she hears about you making such a hit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. McMinn? Has that woman been sneering
about me again? That's one woman, Mary, I can't
stand. I can never do myself justice explaining ideas
in company when that woman is present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Never mind her, uncle. (<i>Coming close beside
him.</i>) Do you mind the time last time, uncle, when you
went up to Belfast for a week to see about that patent
for&mdash;what's this the patent was, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). Last time? Aye? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Yes. Don't you remember you said you
knew of an awfully nice boy that you met, and you were
going to bring him down here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Upon my soul, I had clean forgotten. Yes, yes.
I think I did say something about a young fellow I met.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Was he nice, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>becoming absorbed in the newspaper</i>). Eh?
I think so. Oh. He was&mdash;very nice chap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Well, you said he was coming here to see me,
and he never turned up yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Did I? Very possibly. I suppose he must
have forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>walking away to the left and then back again
pouting</i>). I'm sick of the boys here. There's only Alick
McCready that's anyway passable. When will you see
him again, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well&mdash;possibly, when I go up to town again.
Very soon, perhaps. That is if your father, Mary, can
spare the money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>). I don't know, uncle. You see
that would be five times now, and somehow you never
seem to get anything done. That's what he said, mind
you, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>mournfully</i>). Well! Well! To think of me
toiling and moiling away in that workshop of mine, day
after day, and week after week, and year after year&mdash;and
there's all the thanks you get for it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>somewhat irritably as he gets engrossed
reading</i>). Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Look, if you went up to Belfast again soon,
won't you see that boy? I wonder what he's like. (<i>She
gets close beside her uncle and nestles beside him.</i>) Is he
dark or fair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Yes, yes. I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Dark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Yes. I believe he is dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. And tall?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>trying vainly to read in spite of the interruptions</i>).
Very tall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Oh, how nice! And uncle, is he good-looking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Very. Fine looking fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. That's grand; and uncle, is he well to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. He has every appearance of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Oh you dear old uncle! (<i>She nestles closer
to him.</i>) But maybe he wouldn't look at me when he
has a whole lot of town girls to go with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. My dear niece, you don't know what a very
good-looking young lady you are, and besides he saw
your photograph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Which photograph?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>perplexed</i>). Which photograph? Your own
of course!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. The one I got taken at Lurgan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Yes. I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Oh uncle! That horrid thing! Why didn't
you show him the one I got taken at Newcastle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. My mistake. Very sorry, indeed, Mary, I
assure you. But I tell you what, I'll take the album with
me next time. Will that do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>laughing</i>). There. Now you're only joking.
(<i>Suddenly.</i>) What do you do all the time you stay in
Belfast, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). Um&mdash;um&mdash;&mdash;Business, my dear
girl, business. See engineers and all that sort of thing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and talk things over. It takes time, you know, Mary,
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. You've been an awful long time inventing,
uncle, haven't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well, you know, Mary dear&mdash;time&mdash;it takes
time. You can't rush an inventor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Well look, uncle. You know I can just wheedle
father round my wee finger, can't I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. You can indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Well, look: if you promise to bring down this
boy you are talking about, I'll get father to give you
enough to have two weeks in Belfast. There. It's a
bargain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Um&mdash;well&mdash;he may not be there you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>disappointed</i>). O uncle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. You see he travels a lot and he may be away.
He may be in London. In fact I think&mdash;yes. He said
he would be going to London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Then why not go to London?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>starting up and speaking as if struck with
delight at the possibility</i>). Eh? I never thought of that!
(<i>He collapses again.</i>) But no. Your father, Mary.
He would never give me the money. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. But you're more likely to meet people there
who'd take it up, aren't you, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. It's <i>the place</i> for an inventor to go, Mary.
<i>The place.</i> (<i>Pauses.</i>) But I'm afraid when John hears
about it&mdash;&mdash;(<i>he becomes very dubious and shakes his head</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Well, look here, uncle. Do you mind the last
time when he would not give you money to go up to
Belfast about your patent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>sadly</i>). I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. You remember you got a letter a few days after
asking you to come up at once and you had to go then.
Hadn't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Well, couldn't we do the same this time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>looking at her uneasily</i>). Eh?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Couldn't we get someone to send a letter.
(<i>Pausing and thinking, then suddenly</i>). Oh, the very
thing! You know that silly Alick McCready that comes
running after me. Well, look, I'll get him to send a letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. No good, my dear. I did it before&mdash;&mdash;I mean
letters on plain notepaper don't carry much weight.
No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. What about&mdash;&mdash;oh, I know! Uncle, a telegram!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Great idea! It is in soul!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. And we'll put something on it like "come to
London at once to see about the patent," or something
like that. And he'd have to let you go then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Mary, you're really a cleverer girl than
your father thinks. (<i>Musingly.</i>) Two weeks in London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. And don't forget the nice boy, uncle, when
you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I'll do my best to get hold of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. No. I want a good definite promise. Promise,
uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well, really you know, my dear, he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Uncle, promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Um&mdash;&mdash;well, I promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. You're a dear old thing. You see, uncle, I
don't want to marry Alick McCready or Jim McDowell
or any of those boys, unless there's nobody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Quite right, my dear, quite right. Two weeks
in London. Splendid! But it's time I was going into my
workshop. (<i>He rises and takes the paper with him.</i>) I
must really try and do something this morning. (<i>Exit
by workshop door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>calling after him</i>). You won't forget, uncle?
Will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. No, certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. I do hope uncle brings that nice boy. Dark&mdash;tall&mdash;well
set up&mdash;well to do.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>comes in again through the yard door, and looks at</i>
<span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <i>who is gazing vacantly into space.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Well? What notion have you got now?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Oh! just think, Kate! How would you like
a boy who was dark and tall, and well set up and well
to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. I'd just leap at him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Agh! I don't think he'll ever come,
Kate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. I think you've plenty on hand to manage.
(<span class="smcap">Brown</span> <i>opens the yard door and resumes his old-position
from which he stares at the dresser</i>). You're back again,
are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Aye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. What ails you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I'm looking the spanner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. The spanner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. The spanner, Miss Mary. It's for turning the
nuts like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Have you never got it yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Do you think I've got eyes in the back of my
head? Underneath the seat, beside the salt-box, on
the right near the wee crock in the left hand corner.
(<i>He makes a movement to open one of the drawers of the
dresser.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Will you get out of that, ignorance. It's not
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>with an appealing look at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>). Maybe its
in the parlour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Well, I'll take a look round. (<i>She goes through
the door to living rooms.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>mysteriously</i>). Did you hear the news?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. No. (<i>Very much interested</i>.) What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Ach! You women never know anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. What's the news? Somebody killed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No. More serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>alarmed</i>). God bless me! What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Andy McMinn has a sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>disappointed</i>). Ach!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. And she's trying to get a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Well. I knowed that this years.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. And Mr. John Murray is a widow man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. You mean to be telling me that Mr. John
has a notion of that old thing? Go long with you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Did you ever hear tell of a widow man that
never got married again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Plenty. Don't come in here talking blethers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Whist. There's more in what I'm telling you
than you think. And I'll hold you to a shilling that
Sarah McMinn will be Mrs. John Murray before one
month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Who told you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Ach. You've no more head than a yellow
yorling. Where has Mr. John been going to these wheen
of nights?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>thinking</i>). Andy McMinns!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Aye. Do you think it is to see old Andy?
And sure he's been talking to me all morning about the
way the house is being kept. No hand to save the waste;
bread and things destroyed; hens laying away; eggs
ate up by the dozen and chickens lost and one thing and
another. And hinting about what money a good saving
woman would bring him. And Mr. Daniel&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>. Sh&mdash;&mdash;he's in there working.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Working? Ah, God save us! Him working!
The last man that seen Mr. Dan working is in his grave
this twenty years. (<i>He goes over next workshop door.</i>)
I'll just peep in at him through the keyhole. (<i>He goes
over and does so, and then beckons</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>over. She peeps
in and grins. As they are thus occupied</i> <span class="smcap">Alick McCready</span>
<i>opens the door and stands gazing at them. He is a type
of the young well-to-do farmer, respectably dressed and
good-looking.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. Well! Well! Some people earn their money
easy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Aye. In soul. Just look in there to see it.
(<span class="smcap">McCready</span> <i>looks in and bursts into a loud hearty laugh.</i>
<span class="smcap">Brown</span> <i>hurriedly goes out by the yard door and</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>
<i>by door to inner rooms.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>opening door and standing there, perplexed
looking</i>). What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. Ah. I was just laughing at a wee joke, Mr.
Murray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. It must have been very funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. Aye. It was. (<i>Coming close to</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, <i>who
walks slowly to the middle of the kitchen.</i>) I say. Were
you at McArn's publichouse last night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>looking round cautiously to see that no one else
can hear him</i>). Well, just a minute or two. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. There was someone there told Andy McMinn
this morning, I believe, that you'd been talking of a
great invention altogether, and he was that much curious
to see it that him and his sister Sarah are coming over
this day to have a look at it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Who? Sarah McMinn?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. Aye. She's very anxious to see it, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Um. Rather awkward this. She's not a
woman that, plainly speaking, I care very much to talk
about my ideas to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. But have you got something struck out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. McCready, come here. (<span class="smcap">Alick</span> <i>goes closer
to him.</i>) It is really a great idea. Splendid. But I've
a great deal of trouble over it. In fact I've been thinking
out details of a particular gear all morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. Aye. (<i>He looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>and then endeavours
to restrain unsuccessfully a burst of laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>angrily</i>). You were always an ignorant hound
anyway and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to you. (<i>He turns to go towards
his workshop.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. Ah, Mr. Murray, I beg your pardon. It's
another thing altogether I'm thinking about. I just
wanted a talk with you this morning. You have a nice
wee girl for a niece, Mr. Murray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>somewhat mollified</i>). Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span> (<i>bashfully</i>). And I was wondering if you could
put in a good word for me now and again with her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Now, look here, Alick. We can all work
nice and comfortably together, can't we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. Aye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well, if you behave yourself like a man with
some manners, and not like an ignorant clodhopper, I
can do a great deal for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. Thank you, sir. You know, Mr. Murray, I have
as nice a wee farm, and as good stock on it as well, as any
man in the county, and if I'm lucky enough to get that
niece of yours, you'll always be welcome to come and pass
a day or two and have a chat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I think you and I will get along all right,
Alick. There's one or two little things I need badly
sometimes in this house. I mean I want help often,
you know, Alick, to carry my points with John; points
about going to see people and that sort of thing, and
it's really very hard to manage John on points like that,
unless we resort to certain means to convince him they are
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). Yes. I sort of follow you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. You know what I mean. John's a little dense,
you know. He can't see the point of an argument very
well unless you sort of knock him down with it. Now,
if a thing is fair and reasonable, and a man is so dense
that he can't see it, you are quite justified&mdash;at least,
I take it so&mdash;to manufacture a way&mdash;it doesn't matter
how&mdash;so long as you make that dense man accept the
thing, whatever it is, as right. Do you follow me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. I'm just beginning to see a kind of way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>appearing at door from inner rooms</i>). I can't
see that thing anywhere. (<i>She suddenly sees</i> <span class="smcap">Alick</span>.)
Oh Alick! You here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. Yes. It's a nice morning, and you're looking
beautiful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Oh, bother. (<i>She seems to suddenly recollect
something.</i>) Oh, I say! uncle! You remember?
Uncle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>somewhat perplexed</i>). Eh?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>motioning towards</i> <span class="smcap">Alick</span>). Telegram to come
to London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Ah&mdash;&mdash;Oh, yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Let's go into your workshop and tell Alick
what we want. Come on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span>. I'll do anything in the world you want.</p>

<p>(<i>They all go into the workshop. As they disappear,</i> <span class="smcap">John
Murray</span>, <i>sweating and angry looking, comes through
from the yard followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>is a tall,
stout man, with a rather dour countenance and somewhat
stolid expression. He is a year or so the elder
of Dan in age. He goes to the dresser, puts his
hand on the top shelf, takes down a spanner and throws
it down angrily on the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>. There. There you are, you stupid-looking,
good for nothing, dunder-headed, Italian idiot you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>. You're something terrible cross this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>. (<i>heatedly</i>). Is it any wonder? Away out at once
now and put her to rights and quick about it. (<span class="smcap">Brown</span>
<i>meekly goes out.</i>) The like of servant men nowadays,
I never seen in my mortal days. A concern of ignorant
bauchles, every one of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>opening door of workshop and peeping out. He
sees</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>and goes over to him with a genial air</i>). Good
morning John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>snappishly</i>). Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. John, what do you think, I believe I have
just come on to a great idea about&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>. Ach! You and your great ideas! Here you've
been blundering and blethering and talking these fifteen
years and more, and I've never seen anything come of them
yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>soothingly</i>). I know, John, I know. But I'm
handicapped you know. Bad place to work in and all
the rest of it: but you've been kind to me, John. Keeping
a brother and helping him after he has lost all his
money isn't a common thing with many men, but John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
a day will come sometime, and you'll get it all back.
(<i>Impressively</i>). Every penny. Aye, and twice over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>softening</i>). Thank you, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. You will, John, you will. But don't cast up
things like that about the time I've been. It hurts me.
A thing like this takes time to mature, you know, John.
The great and chief thing for an inventor is time. Look
at Palissy, the great French potter, who found out how
to make porcelain glaze. Why he worked for years and
years at his invention. And there was the man who
found out how to make steam drive engines. Look at
the years those men spent&mdash;and no one begrudged them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>. I suppose that now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Certainly, John, nothing surer. And look
at the fortunes those men made. But the great difficulty
is trying to get someone to take up your patent. You
see these men had the eyes of the world fixed on them.
People knew all about them, and had their hands stretched
out ready to grab what they invented. (<i>Pathetically</i>).
I&mdash;&mdash;I'm just a poor unknown man struggling in a wee
dark corner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>touched</i>). Never mind, Danny. You'll make the
name of the Murray's known yet, maybe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I'll do my best, John. But mind you it would
take me to be pushing on this thing that I have found
out and bringing it before people to notice. You see
I've got it all ready now except for a few small details.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>much interested</i>). Have you now? I would like
you sometime to explain it to me, Daniel. I didn't
quite get on to it the last time you were telling me about
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Some time again. Oh yes. But John&mdash;I'll
have to go to some of the towns soon to see people
about it. The bigger the town the better the chance,
and John (<i>impressively</i>)&mdash;London's the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>aghast</i>). London! In all the name of the
world, yon place! Would Belfast not do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. No. I don't like Belfast. They're a mangy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
stick-in-the-mud, follow-in-the-old-ruts crowd. Never
strike out anything new. It's a case of London or nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>dubiously</i>). It will be a terrible expense this
London visiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> It'll be worth it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Now, Danny, I would like to oblige you, but
what do you think it would cost me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well, I could live cheap you know, John,
and do without meals an odd day, and go steerage and
third class, and that sort of thing. I would say about
fifteen pounds roughly. That would let me stay more
than a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Fifteen pounds! God bless me, Daniel, would
you break me? No, no, I couldn't afford to give you
that much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Maybe ten would do it. I could sleep out
under the arches an odd night or two, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> No, no. I'll not have that. A Murray aye
had a bed to go to and a sup to eat. (<i>After a contemplative
pause.</i>) Here, I'll give you three pounds and
you can go to Belfast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I don't care much about Belfast. You know
I have been there five times now, and I have never got
anyone to look into the thing at all proper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You're too backward, Daniel, when it comes to
the like of that. But ten pounds! No, I would like
you to get on in the world right enough, Daniel, but I
couldn't afford it. You know the way this house is being
kept; it's lamentable. Tea and sugar and flour and things.
Man, I'm just after paying off ten pounds to the McAfees
for one thing and another, and it only a running account
for two months. If I had a good housekeeper now,
maybe things would alter for the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>coming out from the workshop followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Alick</span>).
O Uncle Dan! He says he'll go at once and get it&mdash;&mdash;(<i>She
stops short in confusion on seeing her father.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> How are you, Mr. Murray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> O! bravely. What's the news with you?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> I was just looking over some of them ideas of
Daniel's, about the new fan bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. Now what do you think of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span> (<i>warned by</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>who nudges him</i>). They're
great altogether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Do you think there will be any sale for it at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> I think so. (<i>He perceives</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>motioning
assent.</i>) I believe there would be indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Man, I wish I had the head of some of you
young fellows to understand the working of them
machinery and things. (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>goes back into the
workshop.</i>) I've the worst head in the world for understanding
about them sort of things. There's Daniel,
a great head on him, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span> (<i>slyly</i>). He has, right enough!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>proudly</i>). One of the best. When he was a
wee fellow, dang the one could beat him at making
boats or drawing pictures, or explaining extraordinary
things to you. None. Not one. A great head on him,
Daniel. He'll do something yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Did you know Andy McMinn's for coming
over to see you this day, Mr. Murray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). This day? When? Are you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Aye, so he said. About two o'clock or so.
Someone told him about Daniel's great new idea, and he's
very curious to hear about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> He's always poking his nose into people's
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Whist. Andy McMinn's a very decent man.
Tell me (<i>rather bashfully</i>), was Sarah to come with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>alarmed</i>). O holy prophets! I hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Aye. She's coming too. She wanted to see
it as well as Andy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. Certainly, and she's welcome too. Mary,
you can get the house ready, and the table set, and a
nice tea for them when they come, and I can go and get
tidied up a wee bit. (<i>He goes off through door into inner
rooms.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Alick</span> (<i>leaning against the table and looking across at</i>
<span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <i>who is sitting at the opposite end.</i>) You're as nice
a wee girl as ever I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You're an awful fool. Hurry, Alick, like a
decent man and get that telegram sent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> That uncle of yours, Mary, heth he's as canny
a keoghboy as I've seen. Its the queer tears he'll be
taking to himself in London if I know anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Hold your tongue. You've no business to
talk about Uncle Dan that way. He could give you tons
as far as brains go anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> I believe that. (<i>He goes to yard door, then
turns back.</i>) I say, Mary. What name will I put on that
telegram? "Come to London at once about patent.
Intend purchasing." Hadn't we better have a name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes. I'll just ask uncle. (<i>She knocks at door
of workshop.</i>) Uncle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>without</i>). Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What name will we put to that telegram?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>without</i>). Oh, it's not particular. Wilson
or Smith, or Brown, or Gregg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> I'll put Gregg on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Do well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Did you see the fluster that your father got
into, Mary, when he heard that Sarah McMinn was
coming over?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>alarmed</i>). What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span>. Did you not see how he rushed off to tidy
himself up when he heard Sarah McMinn was coming
over?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>seating herself on chair to right of table</i>). Nonsense.
Father wouldn't think of that woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> All right. But I think I know something
more than you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>anxiously</i>). What? Tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Come on and leave me down the loaning a
pace, and I'll tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>glancing at him, and then coquettishly turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
her back to him as he leans against the table</i>). Oh, I can't.
Those people are coming over, and that McMinn woman
will be looking at everything and telling you how to do
things in front of father, and all the rest of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick</span> (<i>entreatingly</i>). Leave me down the loaning a
pace till I tell you the news.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>teasingly</i>). No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Come on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No. (<span class="smcap">Alick</span> <i>moves sadly towards the door.</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>
<i>looks round, and then laughingly skips past him out through
the yard door, and he follows her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>coming through door from inner rooms partly
dressed, with a towel in his hands, evidently making much
preparation to clean himself</i>). Daniel! (<i>Loudly and
crossly.</i>) Daniel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>peeping out from workshop door</i>). Well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Tidy yourself up a wee bit, man, Andy McMinn
and Sarah's coming over to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>somewhat taken back</i>). Me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. They want to see about the new invention.
You can have the collar I wore last Sunday,
and put on your new coat that you got in Belfast.
(<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>goes back into the workshop.</i>) I wonder what
tie would be the better one? Yon green or the red one
that Mary gave me last Christmas. Aye. (<i>Seeing no
sign of</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.) D&mdash;&mdash;n! Is he making no shapes
to dress himself. Daniel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>without</i>). Aye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>loudly</i>). Daniel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>again appearing at door</i>). Well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>impatiently</i>). Come on and get on you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Ach. This is always the way. Just when
a man has got the whole thing worked out and the plans
of the apparatus just on the point of completion he has
to stop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Never mind, Danny. You can do it again
the night or the morrow morning. I want you to look
decent. Come on and get on you.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>beginning to regard his brother with a sudden

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>at door to rooms</i>). Andy and Sarah McMinn.
(He goes out.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>suddenly realising the import of the preparations
going on.</i>) McMinn. Mc&mdash;&mdash;. (<i>He stops short,
and then in a horrified voice.</i>) Surely to God he hasn't
a notion of that woman? (<i>Calling tremulously.</i>) John!
John!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>at door</i>). Hurry up, man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>appealingly</i>). John. Tell me, John. You
haven't&mdash;&mdash;you're not going to&mdash;&mdash;you haven't a notion
of that woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). Well, Daniel, you see the house
needs some one to look after it proper, and I thought&mdash;&mdash;well&mdash;maybe&mdash;that
Sarah would be just as nice and
saving a woman as I could get, but I thought I would
keep it a bit secret, don't you know, because I don't
know yet if she'd have me or not. And she could talk
to you better nor I could about machinery and things
that would interest you, for she has an agency for sewing
machines, and knows something about that sort of thing,
and you'd get on great with each other. Now, hurry
and get on you. (<i>He goes out by door into rooms.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>looking after him in a helpless manner, and
sinking into a chair</i>). If&mdash;if she'd have him! O great
God! If that woman comes to this house, I&mdash;I'm a
ruined man.</p>

<p><i>The same scene some hours later. The curtain rises to

tea which she has made, and is drinking with relish.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> I suppose they'll be wanting jam and sugar
for the tea&mdash;aye&mdash;and some of them scones Miss Mary
cooked yesterday, not but you couldn't eat them, and a
pat or two of butter. (<i>She finishes off the remains of the
tea.</i>) Now, that's a nice girl for you! Here's company
coming till the house and tea and things a wanting,
and she goes and leaves all to go strolling down the loaning
with that fool of a McCready.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Brown</span> <i>opens the yard door and comes in. He replaces

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Well, yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Do you see any sign of them McMinns yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Aye. I see the trap coming over the Cattle
Hill. There was three in it, as far as I could make out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Who be to be the third party I wonder? Is
it their servant man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Do you think old Andy McMinn's servant

the clergy's? Talk sense, woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Maybe it's yon Scotch body I heard was

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Aye. Yon Mackenzie. Ach, man, but yon

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Aye.</p>

shut could make out what he was laughing at. (<i>Listening.</i>)
Here they are. I hear the wheels coming up the
loaning. I'll have to go and put up the horse for them
I suppose. (<i>He goes out by yard door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> I wonder if the master seen them coming.
(<i>She rapidly clears the table and then goes over to door into
room</i>.) I better tell him. (<i>She knocks at the door</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>without</i>). Aye. (<i>He comes and opens the door,
dressed in his best suit of clothes.</i>) What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> They're just come, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). Are they? (<i>Comes into kitchen.</i>) Is
my tie right, Kate? And my clothes&mdash;is there any dirt
on the back of them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>inspecting him critically</i>). You'll do grand. I
never seen you looking better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Where's Mary? Why isn't she here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> She went out about something. She'll be back
in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Right enough, it would do her all the good in
the world to have a sensible woman looking after her.
She just gets her own way a deal too much in this house.
(<i>He goes to window and looks out.</i>) Aye. Here they are!
Tell Daniel to hurry. (<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>goes off by door to rooms.</i>)
Sarah's looking bravely. Man, that woman could save
me thirty, aye forty, pounds a year if she was here.
(<i>Suddenly.</i>) Ach! Is Daniel never ready yet? (<i>Calls.</i>)
Daniel! (<i>Louder.</i>) Daniel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>without</i>). Aye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Yous are all welcome. Every one of you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
You Andy and Sarah, and Mr. Mackenzie. The Scotch
is aye welcome, Mr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Aye. That's what I said the last time
I was in Ballyannis, and was verra thirsty, and went into
a beer-shop to get a dram&mdash;Black and White it was. Verra
guid. (<i>He laughs loudly at his own joke.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> We brought Mr. Mackenzie along with us
to see your brother, John. You see he's an engineer
and knows a good deal about machinery and plans and
things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Aye. There's not much about machinery
that I dinna ken, Mr. Murray, from a forty thousand
horse power quadruple expansion doon to a freewheel
bicycle. (<i>Proudly.</i>) I hae done spells work at all of them,
you ken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> I suppose Daniel's at home. Is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Daniel? Oh aye, Daniel's at home. He's
just tidying himself up a wee bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> A wee bit paint and powder gangs a
lang gait to make up defects, as you ken yourself, Miss
McMinn. (<i>He laughs loudly.</i>) That's a guid one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>looking slyly at Sarah</i>). He's up out of bed then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>innocently</i>). Oh aye. He sits up late of nights
working out things. (<i>He points to the door of workshop.</i>)
That's his workshop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> He works then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. He works in there. (<i>Andy goes over and
goes into workshop.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Because it doesna follow always, as I have
discovered in my experience, that because a man has a
workshop, he works. (<i>He laughs, evidently much pleased
at his own humour.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>looking out again through door</i>). There's nothing
much to see in this place except a lot of dirty papers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> That's the plans of the bellows he's
working at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>going over to workshop</i>). Come out, Mr.
McMinn, till I examine. (<i>Andy comes out and he passes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
in.</i>) Eh. This is the plan of the great bellows. (<i>He
laughs loudly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Is he making much headway with it, John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Indeed, now, I think he's doing bravely at it.
He's keeping very close at it this day or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> There's a terrible amount of newspapers lying
in there. Has he no other plans and drawings except
what's there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh aye. He has plenty of plans and drawings
somewhere, for I seen them once or twice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>coming out</i>). I can't say much about that
contrivance. (<i>He laughs.</i>) And, I say. Look here.
He does more than draw bellows. He draws corks as
well. (<i>He produces a bottle of whiskey almost empty.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ah, well. He's not a great transgressor either
in the matter of a bottle. No, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> And the smell of smoke in the place!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> John, I think Daniel smokes far too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> He should be dressed by now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. Oh, aye. He should right enough. He's
a wee bit backward before women, you know, Sarah.
(<i>Calls.</i>) Daniel! (<i>He goes over and opens door into rooms.</i>)
Daniel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>without</i>). Yes. (<i>He appears at the door
struggling vainly with his collar.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Why didn't you come long ago. What kept
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Your collar. (<i>He looks across at</i> <span class="smcap">Andy</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Sarah,</span> <i>who have seated themselves at the back.</i>) How
do you do, Andy and Sarah? You're very welcome.
(<i>He looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Mackenzie,</span> <i>who stares curiously at him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> This is a friend of ours, Daniel, that happened
to be stopping with us last summer at Newcastle in the
same house, and he came over for his holidays to us this
time. We brought him over to see you. They calls
him Mackenzie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>crossing over to the left and taking a seat near
the door of the workshop.</i>) How do you do?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>patronisingly</i>). I'm glad to see you at last,
Mr. Murray, for I've heard a good deal about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> You see, Daniel, Mr. Mackenzie is an engineer
in one of the great Scotch engineering yards. (<span class="smcap">Daniel's</span>
<i>face expresses his dismay, which he hurriedly tries to hide</i>.)
What place was it you were in, Mr. Mackenzie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> I served six years in the engine and fitting
shops with Messrs. Ferguson, Hartie &amp; Macpherson,
and was two years shop foreman afterwards to Dennison,
McLachlan &amp; Co., and now I'm senior partner with
the firm of Stephenson &amp; Mackenzie. If ever you're
up in Greenock direction, and want to see how we do it,
just ask for Donal Mackenzie, and they'll show you the
place. (<i>Proudly.</i>) We're the sole makers of the
Mackenzie piston, if ever you heard of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). I'm sorry to say I haven't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> And you call yourself an engineer and
you don't know about Donal Mackenzie's patent
reciprocating piston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>apologetically</i>). You see we be a bit out of the
world here, Mr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes. Now that's one point. One great
point that always tells against me. (<i>Getting courageous.</i>)
It really needs a man to be continually visiting the great
engineering centres&mdash;Greenock, London&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>scornfully</i>). London's not an engineering
centre&mdash;Glasgow, Hartlepool, Newcastle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well, all those places. He could keep
himself posted up in all the newest ideas then, and
inventions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> But a man can keep himself to the fore
if he reads the technical journals and follows their articles.
What technical papers do you get? Do you ever get the
Scottish Engineers' Monthly Handbook, price sixpence
monthly? I'm the writer on the inventors' column.
My articles are signed Fergus McLachlan. Perhaps
you've read them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I think&mdash;um&mdash;I'm not quite sure that I have.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> You remember one I wrote on the new
compressed air drills last July?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>looking across at</i> <span class="smcap">John,</span> <i>who is standing with his
back to the fireplace</i>). I don't think I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> No. We don't get them sort of papers. I
did buy one or two like them for Daniel, but he told me
he would just as soon have the <i>Whig</i>, for there was just
as much information in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>laughing</i>). O spirit of Burns! Just as
much information&mdash;well, so much for that. Now, about
this new patent, this new fan bellows that I hear you're
working at, Mr. Murray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> What about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> We both seen the drawings in there, Daniel,
but I don't think either of us made much of it. Could
you not explain it to him, Daniel. Give him an idea
what you mean to do with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. Now's your chance, Daniel. You were
talking of some difficulty or other. Maybe this gentleman
could help you with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>shifting uneasily, and looking appealingly at</i>
<span class="smcap">John</span>). Well. There's no great hurry. A little later
on in the evening. (<i>He looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah.</span>) I'm thinking
about Miss McMinn. I don't think this conversation
would be very interesting to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Oh, indeed now, Mr. Murray, I just love to
know about it. A good fan bellows would be the great
thing for yon fireplace of ours, Andy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Aye. Soul, it would that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). No. Not just yet, John. A
bit later on. I'm shy, John, you know. A bit backward
before company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You're a man to talk about going to see people
in London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> What? Was he going to London?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. He was talking about going to London,
and I was half-minded to let him go.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>who exchanges meaning glances with</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>).
Boys, that would cost a wheen of pounds!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Who wull you go to see in London?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>evasively</i>). Oh&mdash;engineers and patent agents
and people that would take an interest in that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Have you anyone to go to in particular?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> It will cost a great deal of money, Daniel.
Seven or eight pounds anyway. Won't it, Mr.
Mackenzie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> It would, and more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span> <i>with evident admiration</i>). Man,
that's a saving woman. She can count the pounds.
(<i>Suddenly</i>). Daniel, away out and show Andy and Mr.
Mackenzie the thresher, and get used to the company,
and then you can come in and explain the thing to them.
I want Sarah to stay here and help me to make the tea.
That fool of a Mary is away again somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>after a sly glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>). Aye. Come on,
Daniel, and explain it to us. I hear there's a new kind
of feedboard on her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> How is she driven, Mr. Murray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). How is she what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> How is she worked&mdash;steam, horse, or
water power, which?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>motioning</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>to go, which the latter does
very unwillingly</i>). Go on out and you can show them,
Daniel. (<span class="smcap">Daniel,</span> <span class="smcap">Andy,</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> <i>go out through
yard door.</i>) He's backward, you know, Sarah, oh, aye&mdash;backward;
but a great head. A great head on him,
Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> I suppose he is clever in his way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>seating himself close beside her and talking with
innocent enthusiasm</i>). Ah, boys, Sarah, I mind when he
went to serve his time with McArthurs, of Ballygrainey,
he was as clever a boy as come out of the ten townlands.
And then he set up for himself, you know, and lost all,
and then he come here. He's doing his best, poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
creature, till pay me for what kindness I showed him,
by trying to invent things that he says would maybe
pay off, some time or other, all he owes to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>cynically</i>). Poor Daniel! And he lost all his
money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. Every ha'penny; and he took a hundred
pounds off me as well. And now, poor soul, he hasn't a
shilling, barring an odd pound or two I give him once
or twice a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Well! Well! And he's been a long time this
way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. (<i>Reflectively.</i>) I suppose it's coming on
now to twenty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> It's a wonder he wouldn't make some shapes
to try and get a situation somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ach, well, you know, when Annie, the wife,
died and left Mary a wee bit of a wain, I was lonesome,
and Daniel was always a right heartsome fellow, and I
never asked him about going when he came here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> He must be rather an expense to you. Pocket
money for tobacco, and whenever he goes out a night
to McArn's, its a treat all round to who is in at the
time. And his clothes and boots, and let alone that, his
going to see people about patents and things up to
Belfast three or four times in the year. If he was in a
situation and doing for himself, you could save a bit of
money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>pensively</i>). Aye. Heth and I never thought
much of that, Sarah. I could right enough. I'll think
over that now. (<i>He looks at her, and then begins in a
bashful manner.</i>) You weren't at Ballyannis School
f&ecirc;te, Sarah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> No. But I heard you were there. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>coming still closer</i>). I was expecting to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>). I don't believe in young girls
going to them things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>gazing at her in astonishment</i>). But God bless
me, they wouldn't call you young! (<span class="smcap">Sarah</span> <i>turns up her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
nose disgustedly.</i>) I missed you. Man, I was looking
for you all roads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> I'm not a fool sort of young girl that you can
just pass an idle hour or two with, John Murray, mind
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I never thought that of you, Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Some people think that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>astonished</i>). No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> They do. There's Andy just after warning
me this morning about making a fool of myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>puzzled</i>). But you never done that, Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Well, he was just after giving me advice about
going round flirting with Tom, Dick and Harry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ah no. You never done that. Sure I knowed
you this years and years, and you never had a boy to my
knowing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>offended</i>). Well I had, plenty. Only I just
wouldn't take them. I refused more than three offers
in my time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>incredulously</i>). Well! Well! And you wouldn't
have them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Why now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>looking at him meaningly</i>). Well&mdash;I liked
somebody else better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>piqued</i>). Did he&mdash;the somebody&mdash;did he never
ask you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> He might yet, maybe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>hopelessly to himself</i>). I wonder would it be any
use then me asking her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> And I'm beginning to think he is a long time
thinking about it. (<i>Knocking at the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Ach! Who's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>opening yard door and looking in</i>). Me, sir.
Mr. Dan wants to know could you not come out a minute,
and show the gentlemen what way you can stop the
feedboard working.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Don't you know yourself, you stupid headed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
lump you. Away back at once. (<span class="smcap">Brown</span> <i>hurriedly
closes the door after an inquiring glance at the pair.</i>) That's
them servant men for you. He knowed rightly what
way it worked, only he was just curious. (<i>Savagely.</i>)
He's a stupid creature, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> I think all men is stupid. They never see
things at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Now, Sarah, sure women are just as bad. There's
Mary. She's bright enough someways, but others&mdash;ach&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Mary needs someone&mdash;a woman&mdash;to look
after her. Somebody that knows how to manage a
house and save money. She's lost running about here.
Now, I had a young girl with me once was a wild
useless thing when she came, and when she left me six
months after, there wasn't a better trained, nor as meek
a child in the whole country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> And you can manage a house, Sarah, and well,
too. Can't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> I ran the house for Andy there twenty years
and more, and I never once had to ask him for a pound.
And what's more, I put some into the bank every quarter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Did you now? (<i>He looks at her in wondering
admiration.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Yes. And I cleared five pounds on butter
last half year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>with growing wonder</i>). Did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> And made a profit of ten pounds on eggs
alone this year already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>unable to contain himself any longer</i>). Sarah, will
you marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>coyly</i>). Oh, John, this is very sudden. (<i>Knocking
at yard door.</i>) I will. I will. Will you tell them
when they come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>now that the ordeal has been passed, feeling somewhat
uncomfortable</i>). Well, I would rather you waited a
few days, and then we could let them know, canny, don't
you know, Sarah. Break the news soft, so to speak. Eh?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>disappointedly</i>). Well, if you want it particular
that way I&mdash;(<i>knocking</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>going to door</i>). Aye, I'd rather you did. (<i>He
goes to the door and opens it and</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>comes in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I peeped through the window and I thought,
perhaps, it would be better to knock first. It's a nice
evening Miss McMinn. (<i>She takes off her hat and flings
it carelessly on a chair.</i>) Where's Uncle Dan? I want
to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> He'll be in soon enough. He's out showing
Andy and Mackenzie the thresher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Uncle Dan! What does he know
about&mdash;&mdash;(<i>she stops short, remembering that</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span> <i>is
present.</i>) Mr. Mackenzie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Yes. He's a gentleman, a friend of ours,
engaged in the engineering business, who has a large place
of his own in Scotland, and we brought him over here
to see your Uncle Dan about the invention he's
working at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You stop here, Mary, with Sarah, and get the
tea ready. You should have been in the house when
company was coming. Where were you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, just down the loaning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Who with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Alick McCready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>sternly</i>). Aye. You're gay fond of tralloping
about with the boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> He's not just the sort of young man I would
like to see in your company, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>impertinently</i>). It's none of your business
whose company I was in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>disapprovingly</i>). Now, Mary, remember your
manners in front of your elders, and mind you must
always show Miss McMinn particular respect. (<i>Impressively</i>).
Particular respect. (<i>Going towards yard
door.</i>) And you can show Sarah what you have in the
house, and do what she bids you. Them's my orders.
(<i>He goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>looking disapprovingly at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>). I wonder a
girl like you has no more sense than to go gallivanting
about at this time of day with boys, making talk for the
whole country side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>sharply</i>). I don't have to run after them to other
people's houses anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> And that is no way to be leaving down your hat.
(<i>She picks it up and looks at it.</i>) Is that your Sunday one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>snatching it out of her hand</i>). Just find out for
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Now, you should take and put it away carefully.
There's no need to waste money that way, wearing things
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>with rising temper</i>). Do you know it's <i>my</i> hat?
Not yours. And I can do what I like with it. (<i>She
throws it down and stamps on it.</i>) I can tramp on it if I
want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>smiling grimly</i>). Oh, well, tramp away. It's
no wonder your father complained of waste and this sort
of conduct going on.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>comes in through door from rooms.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Have you got the tea things ready, Kate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Yes, Miss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I suppose we better wet the tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>looking at the fire</i>). Have you the kettle on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Can't you see for yourself it's not on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Here, girl (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>), fill the kettle and put it
on. (<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary,</span> <i>and with a shrug of her shoulders,
obeys the orders.</i>) Where's the tea till I show you how
to measure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>in a mocking voice</i>). Kate, get Miss McMinn
the tea cannister till she shows you how to measure.
(<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>goes to the dresser and brings the teapot and
cannister over to</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span> <i>at the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> But it's <i>you</i> I want to show. (<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>pays
no attention, but sits down idly drumming her fingers on the
table.</i>) There now&mdash;pay particular attention to this.
(<i>She takes the cannister from</i> <span class="smcap">Kate,</span> <i>opens it and ladles out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the tea with a spoon into the teapot.</i>) One spoonful for
your father and uncle, one for my brother and Mr.
Mackenzie, one for yourself and me, and half-a-one
for Kate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Do you see that, Kate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Yes, Miss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>mockingly</i>). Now the next thing, I suppose,
is to weigh out the sugar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> No. You always ask the company first do
they take sugar before you pour out the tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No; not in good society. You put it on the
saucers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Put some in the bowl, Kate, and never heed her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>almost tearfully</i>). You've no business to say
that, Kate! Who's your mistress here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>very promptly</i>). You, Miss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Then do what I tell you. Put on the tablecloth,
and lay the cups and saucers, and make everything
ready, and take no orders except from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Very well. I'll learn her manners when I
come to this house. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>) I want to see the china.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Well, go into the next room and look for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>going towards door to rooms</i>). You better mind
what your father told you. (<i>She goes in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>making a face after her</i>). You nasty old thing.
(<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>appears at the door from yard. He is nervous and
worried looking. He goes and sits down near the fireplace,
wearily.</i>) Uncle Dan. (<i>She goes over close beside
him.</i>) Wasn't it good of Alick? He went away to Ballyannis
Post Office to get that telegram sent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> A very decent fellow, Alick. (<i>Gratefully.</i>)
Very obliging.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>confidingly</i>). Do you know, uncle, when he
went off to send that telegram I was nearly calling him
back. I don't care so very much now whether I see that
boy you were telling me about or not. Is he&mdash;do you
think, uncle&mdash;is he much nicer than Alick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Nicer? (<i>He looks at his niece, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
begins to divine the way her feelings lie.</i>) Well, of course
we have all our opinions on these things you know,
Mary, but Alick&mdash;well, after all there's many a worse
fellow than Alick, isn't there? (<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>does not answer,
but puts her head close to her uncle.</i>) Ah, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>suddenly</i>). Uncle! Do you know what has
happened? I heard father proposing to Miss McMinn!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>groaning</i>). Oh my! I knew it would happen!
I knew it would happen! When? Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> In here. I wanted to slip in quietly after
leaving Alick down the loaning when I overheard the
voices. It was father and Miss McMinn. She was
telling him how she had saved five pounds on butter last
half year, and ten pounds on eggs this year, and then
father asked her to marry him. I knocked at the door
out of divilment, and she just pitched herself at him.
I&mdash;I'm not going to stay in the house with that woman.
I'd sooner marry Alick McCready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>despairingly</i>). I would myself. I daren't&mdash;I
couldn't face the look of that woman in the
mornings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> It's all right for you to talk, uncle. You'll
be working away at your inventions, and that sort of thing,
and will have nothing much to do with her, but I'd be
under her thumb all the time. And I hate her, and I
know she hates me. (<i>Tearfully.</i>) And then the way
father talks about her being such a fine housekeeper,
and about the waste that goes on in this house, it nearly
makes me cry, just because I have been a bit careless
maybe. But I could manage a house every bit as well
as she could, and I'd show father that if I only got another
chance. Couldn't I uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>soothingly</i>). And far better, Mary. Far
better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> And you could do far more at your invention
if you only got a chance. Couldn't you, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> No doubt about it, Mary. None. I never
got much of a chance here.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I wonder could we both try to get another
chance. (<i>Suddenly, with animation.</i>) Uncle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Aren't you going to explain that fan bellows
thing you've been working at to them when they come in?
(<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>nods sadly.</i>) Well, look. That Scotchman&mdash;he
understands things like that, and that's just the reason
why that nasty woman brought him over. Just to trip
you and show you up, and she thinks she'll make father
see through you. But just you rise to the occasion and
astonish them. Eh, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). Um&mdash;well, I don't know. That
Scotchman's rather a dense sort of fellow. Very hard to
get on with somehow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Now, Uncle Dan, it's our last chance. Let us
beat that woman somehow or other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> It's all very well, Mary, to talk that way.
(<i>Suddenly.</i>) I wonder is there a book on machinery in
the house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Machinery? Let me think. Yes, I do believe
<span class="smcap">Kate</span> was reading some book yesterday about things,
and there was something about machinery in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> For Heaven's sake, Mary, get it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>calling</i>). Kate! Are you there, Kate? (<span class="smcap">Kate</span>
<i>comes in from inner rooms.</i>) Where's that book you were
reading last night, Kate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>surprised</i>). For dear's sake, Miss! Yon dirty
old thing? The one with the big talk between the
old fellow and the son about everything in the world
you could think of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes, yes. Uncle Dan wants it. (<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>fetches
a tattered volume from the dresser and hands it to</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel.</span>
<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>opens it, and reads while the two girls peer over his
shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>reading slowly</i>). "The Child's Educator. A
series of conversations between Charles and his father
regarding the natural philosophy, as revealed to us, by
the Very Reverend Ezekiel Johnston."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> (<i>much interested</i>). Aye. Just go on till you see
Mr. Dan. Its the queerest conversation between an
old lad and his son ever you heard tell of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>reading</i>). Ah! "The simple forms of machines.
The lever, the wedge, the inclined plane&mdash;Father&mdash;and
here we come to further consider the application of this
principle, my dear Charles, to what is known as the
differential wheel and axle. Um Charles&mdash;Father&mdash;Charles.
Father." (<i>He looks up despairingly at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary.</span>)
No good, my dear. Out of date. (<i>He, however, resumes
reading the book carefully.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>nudging</i> <span class="smcap">Mary,</span> <i>and pointing to door into rooms</i>).
She's going into all the cupboards and drawers, and looking
at everything. (<i>She turns to go back and opens the
door to pass through.</i>) I never seen such a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>raising her voice so as to let</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span> <i>hear her</i>).
Just keep an eye on her, Kate, and see she doesn't take
anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I might get something out of this. Atmosphere.
Pressure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Uncle Dan. (<i>He pays no attention, but is
absorbed in the book</i>). Uncle Dan, I'm going down the
loaning a pace. Alick said he might be back, and I
think&mdash;(<i>she sees he is not listening, and slips back to look
over his shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>reading</i>). Charles. And now my dear father,
after discussing in such clear and lucid terms the use of
the barometer, and how it is constructed, could you tell
me or explain the meaning of the word "pneumatic."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>going towards yard door</i>). Good luck, Uncle
Danny. I'm away. (<i>She goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. There's not much here about bellows.
(<i>Hopelessly.</i>) I wish I had made up this subject a little
better. (<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>comes in evidently much perturbed and
angry.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> The divil take her and them remarks of hers.
Who gave her the right to go searching that way, I
wonder? Where's the silver kept, and was it locked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and how many spoons was there, and why weren't they
better polished; and part of the china broke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>coming to door and speaking. As soon as</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>
<i>hears her voice he hurriedly retreats across to the workshop.</i>)
Where do you keep the knives and forks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> You don't want forks for the tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> I want to count them.</p>

<p>Kate (<i>in amazement</i>). Oh, God save us! You'd think
there was a pross on the house! (<i>She follows</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span> <i>in
through door</i> <span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> <i>comes in, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">John,</span>
<i>then</i> <span class="smcap">Andy.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> And it was a great idea, you know. The
steam passed through the condenser, and the exhaust
was never open to the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>evidently much impressed, and repeating the
word in a wondering manner</i>) Aye. The exhaust!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Aye. The exhaust. But now I'm verra
anxious to hear your brother explaining what he's made
out about the bellows. Its the small things like that
you ken that a man makes a fortune of, not the big ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>impressed</i>). Do you think that now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> You know I take a particular interest
in bellows myself. I tried my hand a good while working
out a new kind of bellows, and I flatter myself that I
know something about the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. (<i>Looking round.</i>) Where's Daniel?
Daniel! Are you there, Daniel? (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>comes out and
stands near the door.</i>) You could maybe bring them plans
out you're working at and explain it to them now, Daniel.
Eh? And wait, Sarah wants to hear it too. (<i>Calling.</i>)
Are you there, Sarah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>seating himself sadly</i>). Aye. She's in there
somewhere taking stock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>going next door to rooms</i>). Are you there, dear?
(<span class="smcap">Sarah</span> <i>comes out.</i>) Daniel's going to explain the thing
to us, and you wanted to hear about it. Didn't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> I'm just dying to know all about it. (<i>She
seats herself to the right at back.</i> <span class="smcap">Andy</span> <i>sits on one side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of the table and</i> <span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> <i>at the other, expectantly, while</i>
<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>goes over to the fireplace almost opposite his brother.</i>)
You know, Mr. Daniel, that's one thing we want very
bad in our house&mdash;a good fan bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> They are very useful, very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. They are that. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>). He has
a good head on him, Daniel. Eh? (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel.</span>) Now
go on and make it very plain so that every one can follow
you. Bring out the plans and show us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>uneasily</i>.) I can explain it better without them.
(<i>After a pause.</i>) Well, I suppose this subject of bellows
would come under the heading of pneumatics in
natural philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh, now, don't be going off that way. Could
you not make it plainer nor that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>appealingly</i>). Well. Could I be much plainer,
Mr. Mackenzie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>cynically</i>). I'm here to discuss fan bellows,
not pneumatics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>sotto voce</i>). D&mdash;&mdash;n him. (<i>He pulls himself
together.</i>) Well. Then I suppose the first thing is&mdash;well&mdash;to
know what is a bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Aye. Man, Daniel, you start off just the same
as the clergy. That's the way they always goes on
expounding things to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>severely</i>). Don't be interrupting, Andy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>sneeringly</i>). Well, I think everyone here
knows what a bellows is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Everyone here? Do you, John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. I would like, Daniel, to hear right what
a bellows is. I mean I can see the thing blowing up a
fire when you use it, any man could see that&mdash;but its
the workings of it. What's the arrangements and
internal works of the bellows now, Daniel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well, you push the handles together in an
ordinary bellows and&mdash;and the air&mdash;blows out. (<i>Seeing
that this statement is received coldly.</i>) Now, why does
it blow out?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>disappointedly</i>). Because it's pushed out of course.
There's no sense in asking that sort of a question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well, there's a flap on the bellows&mdash;a thing
that moves up and down. Well, that flap has all to do
with pushing the air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Maybe this scientifican business is uninteresting
to you, Sarah, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>brightening up at the suggestion</i>). I'm sure
it is. Perhaps we better stop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>smiling grimly</i>). Oh, not at all. I want to hear
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> You're wasting a lot of my time, Mr.
Murray. I came here to hear about a fan bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>confusedly</i>). Oh, yes. Yes. Certainly. Fan
bellows. There's a difference between a fan bellows
and an ordinary bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>opening door from yard and coming in</i>). Oh,
Uncle Dan, are you explaining it to them. Did I miss
much of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> I don't think it matters much what time
you come in during this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>impatiently</i>). Go on, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> It's very hard for me to go on with these
constant interruptions. Well, I was just saying there
was a difference between a fan bellows and an ordinary
bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Now, what is a fan bellows yourself, Mr.
Murray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>hopelessly</i>). A fan bellows? Ah. Why now
is it called a fan bellows?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>roughly</i>). Don't be asking me my own
questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>with a despairing effort</i>). Well, now we will
take it for granted it is because there must be something
of the nature of a fan about a fan bellows. It is because
there are fans inside the casing. And the handle being
turned causes these&mdash;eh&mdash;fans to turn round too. And
then the air comes out with a rush.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. It must be the fans that pushes it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Exactly. Well, now, the difficulty we find
here is&mdash;(<i>he pauses</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Aye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Go on, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> You want a constant draught blowing. That's
number one. Then&mdash;well&mdash;the other. You see, if
we took some of these fans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>in a floundering way</i>). And put them in a
tight-fitting case, and put more of them inside, and
understood exactly what their size was, we could arrange
for the way that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>in a puzzled way to</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>). I can only follow
Daniel a short way too. (<i>Repeating slowly.</i>) Put them
in a tight-fitting case&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>appearing at yard door with a telegram in his
hand, and speaking with suppressed excitement</i>). A telegram
for Mr. Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>with a gasp of relief</i>). Ah! (<i>He tears it open
and proudly reads it out aloud.</i>) "Come to London at
once to explain patent. Want to purchase. Gregg."</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Brown</span> <i>goes out again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Who? Gregg?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I suppose I better go, John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Let's see the telegram. (<i>He goes over to</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel,</span>
<i>who hands it to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> If you go to London, it'll take you to
explain yourself a bit better, Mr. Murray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>who has resumed his place at the fire, and is looking
carefully at the telegram</i>). That will mean how many
pounds, Daniel, did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>promptly</i>). Fifteen, John. (<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>goes out
by door to rooms.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Who is Gregg?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Gregg? Ah. He's a man lives in London.
Engineer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>dubiously</i>). Well, I suppose you&mdash;(<i>he pauses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
then hands the telegram to</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>, <i>who stretches out her hand
for it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>at door</i>). Tea's ready. (<i>She stands aside to
let the company past.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> We didn't hear all about the bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>). No, nor you never will. (<i>He
rises and goes through the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>rising and stretching himself wearily</i>).
Any more, Mr. Murray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I refuse to discuss the matter any further
in public. (<i>He goes off across to tea.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>going over to John and looking at him
knowingly</i>). Do you know what it is, Mr. Murray? Your
brother's nothing short of an impostor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>much offended</i>). Don't dare to say that of a
Murray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>). Well, I'm going
for some tea. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> John, I've something to say to you again about
Daniel, but the company's waiting. (<i>She goes out to
the tea room.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>sitting down moodily</i>). Aye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Are you not coming, father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Father! Surely you aren't going to marry that
woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Don't talk of Sarah that ways. I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Well, if you are, I'm going to say yes to Alick
McCready. I don't want to yet awhile, but I'm not going
to stay on here if that nasty woman comes. (<i>She kneels
close beside her father and puts her arms round his neck.</i>)
Oh, father, if you only give me another chance, I could
show you I could keep house every bit as well as that
woman. (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>appears at the door. He slips across
to the workshop unobserved.</i>) Give me another chance,
father. Don't marry her at all. Let me stay with you&mdash;won't
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You're too late. She's trothed to me now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Pooh. I'd think nothing of that. (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span>
<i>comes out of the workshop with a bag.</i>) Uncle Dan!
What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Mary, I can't eat and sit beside that Scotchman.
(<i>He notices</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>is absorbed in deep thought, and
motions</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>to slip out. She does so, and he looks
observingly at</i> <span class="smcap">John,</span> <i>and then goes to the table, and makes
a noise with the bag on the table.</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>watches him a
moment or two in amazed silence.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> What are you doing, Daniel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Just making a few preparations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ah, but look here. I haven't settled about
London yet, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Oh, London, John. (<i>Deprecatingly.</i>) Let
that pass. I won't worry you about that. (<i>Broken
heartedly.</i>) I'm leaving your house, John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>astonished</i>). What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> You've been kind, John. Very kind. We
always pulled well together, and never had much cross
words with one another, but&mdash;well, circumstances are
altered now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You mean because I'm going to marry Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Exactly. That puts an end to our long and
pleasant sojourn here together. I'll have to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>affected</i>). Oh easy, Daniel. Ah, now, Sarah
always liked you. She thinks a deal of you, and I'm sure
she'd miss you out of the house as much as myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> John, I know better. She wants me out of
this, and I would only be a source of unhappiness. I
wouldn't like to cause you sorrow. She doesn't believe
in me. She brought that Scotchman over to try and
show me up. You all think he did. You think I mugged
the thing. You don't believe in me now yourself. (<i>He
puts a few articles of clothing, &amp;c., into the bag.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>awkwardly</i>). Aye. Well&mdash;to tell you the truth,
Daniel, you did not make much of a hand at explaining,
you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>pathetically</i>). I thought so. Look here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
One word. (<i>He draws</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>aside.</i>) Do you think
Mackenzie invented that patent reciprocating piston
that he's so proud of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>looking at him in amazement</i>). What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>impressively</i>). Well. I know something about
that. He stole it off another man, and took all the
profits. I knew that. Do you think I'm going to give
away the product of my brains explaining it to a man
like that! No fear, John. (<i>He turns again to the bag.</i>)
I'm taking details of my bellows, and my coat, and a
few socks, and the pound you gave me yesterday, and
I'm going to face the world alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>moved</i>). No, no. You'll not leave me, Daniel.
Ah, no. I never meant that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> If she's coming here I'll have to go, and may
as well now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>without</i>). John Murray!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>retreating slowly to the workshop</i>). I'm going
to get that other coat you gave me. It's better than this
one for seeing people in. (<i>He goes into workshop as</i>
<span class="smcap">Sarah</span> <i>comes out into the kitchen. She is evidently displeased.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Hurry up, John. The company's waiting on
you, and I don't know what's keeping you. Unless it
was that brother of yours, more shame to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. Daniel kept me. (<i>Looking at her.</i>) He's
talking of leaving. You wouldn't have that, Sarah,
would you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>sharply</i>). Leaving, is he? And a right good
riddance say I. What has he done but ate up all your
substance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>astonished</i>). You wouldn't put him out, Sarah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>snappishly</i>). I just wouldn't have him about
the place. An idle, good for nothing, useless, old pull
a cork.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Do you not like him, Sarah? (<i>Somewhat
disapprovingly.</i>) You told me you thought a good deal
of him before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Aye. Until I seen through him. Him and
his letters and telegrams. Just look at that. (<i>She shows
him the telegram.</i>) It comes from Ballyannis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>scratching his head in puzzled wonder</i>). I don't
understand that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> He just put up some one to send it. Young
McCready or someone. You couldn't watch a man like
that. No. If I come here, out he goes. You expects
me to come and save you money and the like of that old
bauchle eating up the profits. (<i>She goes towards the door
into tea room.</i>) Come into your tea at once. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> By me sang he was right. (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>comes out
and starts brushing his coat loudly to attract</i> <span class="smcap">John's</span> <i>attention,
and then goes across towards him and holds out his hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I'll say good-bye, John. Maybe I'll never
see you again. (<i>He appears much affected.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>touched</i>). Ach. Take your time. I don't see
the sense of this hurrying. Stop a week or two, man.
I'll be lonesome without you. We had many a good
crack in the evenings, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> We had, John. And I suppose now that
you'll be married I'll have to go, but many a time I'll be
sitting lonely and thinking of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. You were always the best of company,
and heartsome. You were, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well, I did my best, John, to keep&mdash;(<i>he half
breaks down</i>)&mdash;to keep up a good heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You did. I wouldn't like to lose you, Daniel.
(<i>He looks at the telegram in his hand.</i>) But Daniel. This
telegram. It comes from Ballyannis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>taken aback, but recovering his self possession.</i>)
Ballyannis? Ballyannis? Ah, of course. Sure Gregg,
that London man, he was to go through Ballyannis
to-day. He's on a visit, you know, somewhere this way.
It's him I'm going to look for now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Was that the way of it? (<i>With rising anger at
the thought of the way in which his brother has been treated.</i>)
And she was for making you out an impostor and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
putting you out. I didn't like them talking of a Murray
the way they done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>with sudden hope</i>). Are you engaged to that
McMinn woman, John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. I spoke the word the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Was there anybody there when you asked her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> There was no one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Did you write her letters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> No. Not a line.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> And did you visit and court much at the home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> No. I always seen Andy on business and
stopped to have a word or two with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>appealingly</i>). Then, John, John, it's not too
late yet. (<i>Desperately.</i>) Give me&mdash;ah, give wee Mary
another chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>at door</i>). Come in, John, at once. Your tea's
cold waiting, and it's no way to entertain company that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>angrily</i>). D&mdash;&mdash;n her. Daniel! Out of this
home you will not go. I'd rather have your crack of a
winter night as two hundred pounds in the bank and yon
woman. (<i>He reaches out his hand.</i>) I'll break the match.
(<i>The two men shake hands.</i>)</p>

<p><i>The same scene two weeks later.</i> <span class="smcap">Brown</span> <i>comes in by

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>shouting loudly</i>). Miss Mary! Are you there,

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>coming in from parlour</i>). Hi there. Stop that
shouting. D'ye want to wake the dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> I want to give these letters to Miss Mary.
Where is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Who're they for? Let's look at them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Not for you anyway. (<i>Loudly.</i>) Miss Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Ach quit deaving me with your shouting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>coming in</i>). What's the matter? Oh! Letters!
Any for me, Sam?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Aye. There's a post card for you, Miss Mary,
and a registered letter for Mr. John. The posty says
he'll call on the road back for the account when you
sign it. (<i>He hands the post card to</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>and looks carefully
at the letter.</i>) It's like the <span class="smcap">McMinn</span> writing that.
(<i>He looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary,</span> <i>who is reading and re-reading the post
card with a puzzled expression.</i>) Isn't Mr. Dan to be
home to-day from Belfast, Miss Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Isn't Mr. Dan expected home to-day from
Belfast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> I wonder did he get the bellows sold? There
was great talking about him last night in McArn's. Some
said he had sold it and made a fortune. (<i>He breaks off
abruptly on seeing that</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>pays no attention to him, and
then peers over to see what she is reading.</i>) Post cards
is interesting things. Picture post cards is.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Here. Away out and get them purtas dug for
the dinner. We're tired hearing your gabble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>retreating to door and eyeing</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>meaningly</i>).
The master was complaining again to me yesterday evening
about the dinner he got. There's no mistake he
likes his meat like myself, and right enough it was bad
yesterday. I was chowing haws all evening to keep off
the hunger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Go on you out of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> That's all the news this morning. (<i>He makes

<p>What does that mean? "How's the uncle?" It's some

be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> It's not McCready, Miss, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No. That's not his writing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Och, Miss Mary! Do you see the picture of the
Highland man dancing, and under it&mdash;"A Mackenzie
Clansman." It's thon Scotch fellow sent it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Just like the way he would do. I met him again
one night we were over at the doctor's, and he was trying
to make up to me all he was able.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Aye. Any word from Mr. Dan about the boy
he was to bring you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No. I'm not going to bother any more about
boys, I'm going to keep house from this on properly.
But Uncle Dan said something in his last letter about a
great surprise he had for all of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Surprise enough it will be, and he lands home
with a ha'penny in his pocket. The last time he come
home he borrowed a shilling of me and niver paid me

you. (<i>She hands it to him.</i>) A registered one too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. So Brown was telling me. Maybe its
from thon McAlenan fellow that owes me two pound
for the heifer. (<i>He tears it open.</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>
<i>watch him with interest. His face changes as he reads, and

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>coming closer to him</i>). What's the matter,
father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>fidgeting uneasily</i>). Nothing, child. Nothing.
(<i>He looks at the letter again.</i>) Well I'm&mdash;(<i>He stops
short on remembering</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>is there.</i>) She's a caution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Father. Tell me. Is it from the McMinns?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. (<i>Pacing up and down.</i>) I knowed she'd
do it. I knowed she'd do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Sarah's taking an action against me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> An action?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. (<i>Consulting the letter.</i>) For a thousand
pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>awestruck</i>). A thousand pounds!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. Now the fat's in the fire. She says I
promised to marry her and broke it off. At least, it's
Andy that writes the letter, but it's her that put him up
to it. I know that too well. (<i>Reading.</i>) "To Mr. John
Murray. Dear Sir,&mdash;You have acted to my sister in
a most ungentlemanly way, and done her much wrong,
and I have put the case intil the hands of Mr. McAllen,
the solicitor, who will bring it forward at the coming
Assizes. If you wish, however, to avoid a scandal, we
are oped to settle the matter by private arrangement for
one thousand pounds. Yours truly, Andrew McMinn."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> That's awful, father, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>going over to fireplace and standing there
irresolutely</i>). Aye. It's a terrible mess, right enough.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>brightening up</i>). Sure she wouldn't get a
thousand off you, father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> There's John McArdle up by Slaney Cross got
a hundred pounds took off him by wee Miss Black, the
school teacher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). Aye. Heth now, I just call that
to mind. And he never got courting her at all, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> It just served him right. He was always a
great man for having five or six girls running after him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> And she hadn't much of a case against him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> The school children were standing by when he
asked her in a joking sort of way would she marry him,
and the court took their evidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>hopelessly</i>). Aye. Men are always terrible hard
on other men where women are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> And a good job it is, or half the girls would be
at the church waiting, and the groom lying at home
rueing his bargain. (<i>She goes out by yard door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>going up to her father</i>). Father, has she a good
case against you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>after a moment of deep thought</i>). No. I don't
think it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Don't worry so much then, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> It's the jury I'm so frightened of. They all
come from the mountainy district at this Assizes, and
there's not a man of them but wouldn't put a knife in me,
the way I get beating them down in price at the fairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I don't think they'd give her fifty pounds
when they see her. It's only good looking girls would
get big sums like a thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> It's all very well, Mary, but she could dress
herself to look nice enough, the same Sarah, if she liked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> She could not, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> They say, at least Brown was hinting to me,
that its yon Scotch fellow, Mackenzie, has put up the
McMinns to this business. He and that connection
are as thick as thieves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> He mightn't be so very fond of them. When
a man sends post cards to a girl he doesn't know very well,
he's got a wee bit of a liking for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> What are you talking about? I never sent her
any post cards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Father, what are you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>despairingly</i>). I'm d&mdash;&mdash;d if I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Will you defend the case?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I don't want to go near the court at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Father! (<i>Alarmed.</i>) Father! Sure you
wouldn't&mdash;you couldn't think of marrying her after
all that row that happened? (<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>remains silent.</i>)
Wouldn't you rather lose a thousand pounds and keep
me, father? (<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>breaks a piece of soda bread morosely
and eats it.</i>) Wouldn't you, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ah! (<i>He spits out the bread.</i>) Heaven save us,
what kind of bread's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>taking away the bread and putting it behind her
back.</i>) Father! Ah please, please, don't marry her
anyway. Sure you won't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>coming in hastily</i>). Here's Mr. Dan coming up
the loaning, sir, that grand looking you'd hardly know
him, and a big cigar in his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Daniel back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, I must go out and meet him. (<i>She goes
out by yard door quickly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Had he his luggage with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Aye. He has yon big portmanteau of his,
and a parcel of something or other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Away out and help him then, can't you?
(<span class="smcap">Brown</span> <i>goes out.</i>) I wonder what kept him in Belfast
all this time. I suppose he's spent most of the five
pounds I gave him. Like enough. I never mind him
coming back yet with a ha'penny on him. (<i>He sits down
at the fireplace and looks again at the letter.</i>) A thousand
pounds! And there never was a breach of promise case
known where they didn't bring in a verdict for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
woman. Never! (<i>He becomes absorbed in thought, and
as he sits ruminating</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>opens the door, carrying a large
brown paper parcel, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>is dressed
fairly well, and seems to be in high spirits.</i> <span class="smcap">Brown</span> <i>follows
him carrying a portmanteau.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>brightly</i>). Home again, John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>morosely</i>). Aye. It was near time, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Saw quite a number of people this time, John.
A great number. They were all very much interested.
Fine town, Belfast. Growing very rapidly. Wonderful
place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What's in the parcel? (<i>She looks at it with
great curiosity.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Ah, that&mdash;that't the great secret. Mum's
the word. All in good time, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Will I leave your bag here, Mr. Dan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes. Here's a sixpence for you. (<i>He hands
it to</i> <span class="smcap">Brown.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You're brave and free-handed with your money.
Giving the like of that bauchle sixpence. (<span class="smcap">Brown,</span> <i>who
is going out through yard door, stares back at his master
protestingly, and then goes out.</i>) The Lord knows but
we will be wanting every ha'penny we can scrape together,
and soon enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I didn't tell Uncle Dan yet, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>seating himself near the workshop door</i>). Has
anything happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes. Sarah McMinn has&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Read that letter, Daniel. (<i>He goes across and
hands</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>the letter, and goes back to the fireplace to
watch him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>taking out his glasses and solemnly perusing the
letter</i>). Um.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Well? What do you think of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>endeavouring to appear cheerful.</i>) Keep up a
stout heart, John. You're safe enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh, heth, I'm not so sure of that. Sure you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
never heard tell of a jury yet that didn't give damages
against the defendant in a breach of promise case. Did
you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Tuts, man. She has no case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Case or no case it doesn't seem to matter.
What sort of case had Jennie Black against John McArdle,
of Slaney Cross? None. What sort of case had Maggie
McAndless against old William Boyd? None at all. I
was at both of them trials and says to Pat McAleenan&mdash;"the
girl has no case at all!" But for all that they
brought in a verdict for one hundred pounds against
McArdle, and they put two hundred against old Boyd,
and nearly broke the two of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> It's very awkward this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Did you do anything, Daniel about the bellows?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> The bellows? Aye. (<i>He points at the parcel.</i>)
A good deal, John. It's all there. But it's all not quite
settled yet. A day or two more and you'll see. If all
goes well I'll have a great surprise for you in a day or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>disgustedly</i>). Ach! I suppose you spent every
ha'penny of the money, too, that I gave you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> John. Another surprise for you! Those
people I met and went to, put me up very cheap for the
week. Very cheap. (<i>He produces some money.</i>) Therees
one pound ten and sixpence for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I'll keep the pound to do me to the end of the
month and not ask you for any more, John, after that.
That is if&mdash;well&mdash;(<i>He looks at the parcel.</i>) That thing
there is all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>pocketing the ten and sixpence after counting it
carefully</i>). Daniel. I'm sorry, but there's an account of
some thirty shillings I owe the McArdles, and I want
to pay it the night. So if you don't mind&mdash;(<i>He holds
out his hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>unwillingly</i>). Well, I suppose it can't be
helped, John. But it leaves me just with nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
However, there you are. (<i>He hands the pound over to
him.</i> <span class="smcap">Sam Brown</span> <i>opens the yard door and peeps in
cautiously.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>looking at him angrily</i>). What ails <i>you</i> anyway?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> If you please sir, the posty wants the account
signed for that letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, I forgot all about that. (<i>She picks up the
receipt for the letter from the table.</i>) I'll sign it for you,
father. (<i>She goes over to</i> <span class="smcap">Brown,</span> <i>who whispers somethings.
She nods.</i>) And I'll give it to him myself. (<i>She goes out
following</i> <span class="smcap">Brown.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> It's a serious business, this, about the McMinns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> You're all right, man. Wait a day or two.
Take my advice. Do nothing in a hurry. Sit down and
think it over the way I do when I'm working out a new
idea. Don't rush things. It will all come right in the
end. Just you wait and see if it doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Would it not be better to settle before going
into the court? You know I couldn't stand being pointed
out to of a Sunday morning and one and another talking&mdash;"There's
the man that Sarah McMinn took the breach
of promise case against." No, I couldn't stand that at
all. It would be a disgrace to the Murrays for ever.
I'm wondering now&mdash;&mdash;(<i>He pauses lost in thought.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>alarmed</i>). John. Surely you wouldn't&mdash;you
couldn't think of going back on what you said to me.
Would you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I wonder, Daniel, would you mind so much
after all if I married her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>in an agonised voice</i>). I couldn't stand it.
No, John, I couldn't stay. Any other woman but that
McMinn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>appearing at the door followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Alick
McCready</span>). Come on in, Alick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Good morning, Mr. Murray. How are you,
Mr. Dan? So you are back again? We're all glad to
have you back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Thank you, Alick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Father. Alick says he heard Andy McMinn
talking yesterday to some one at McArdle's shop, and
he was telling them all about the whole business, and
blaming it all on Uncle Dan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> And so the people are talking of me already? Now
that I come to think of it, it was your Uncle Dan, and a
brave ha'penny it's going to cost me. One thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Never mind, Mr. Murray. Maybe Uncle
Dan will do something yet. What about the bellows?
(<span class="smcap">Dan</span> <i>makes a horrified movement to stop</i> <span class="smcap">Alick</span> <i>talking,
but too late.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. Here, Daniel. I'll make a bargain with
you. I'll leave you to the settling of the case, and you
can find the money yourself to pay for it if you want to.
And if you can't find the money, I'll marry her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Father, surely&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> What? That's enough about it. I would
as soon do without the marrying if I could. I don't
want the woman at all, but I'll marry her before she
gets a ha'penny off me. So you can settle it among
yourselves. You can take charge of that letter, Dan,
and make the best you can of it. (<i>He goes angrily out
by yard door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> This is a nice mess you put me in for, Alick.
What the divil made you mention the bellows?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> I'm sorry, Mr. Dan. I wasn't thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> The sooner you start and think a bit the better.
If you don't help to settle the case&mdash;(<i>he looks angrily
at</i> <span class="smcap">Alick</span>)&mdash;well&mdash;I've a good deal of influence with
somebody. (<i>He looks significantly at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary,</span> <i>who is again
examining the parcel.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> I'll do my best, Mr. Dan, to help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What will we do, Uncle Dan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I suppose you've no money, Alick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Well, I haven't much ready money, Mr. Dan,
but I could lend you up to twenty pounds at a pinch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Twenty pounds would hardly be enough.
Would it, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Better get hold of Andy and ask him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I don't like going near that woman at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Alick! Could you not slip over and ask Andy
to come across? You know what the McMinns are like.
He'd come over for a shilling if he thought he'd get one.
Ah, yes. You will, Alick. Won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> I'll go straight across now if you&mdash;if you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> If you'd leave us along the road a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Aye. Do. Mary. Leave him down to the
gate anyway. I want to stay here and think over things
a wee bit. That't the good wee girl. (<i>He gently urges
her out with</i> <span class="smcap">Alick,</span> <i>then goes over to the table, lifts the
parcel, and sits down near the fireplace. Feeling the
parcel.</i>) I'm afraid, Dan Murray, it's all U. P. this
time. I'm afraid it is. (<i>Then an idea seems to dawn on
him, and he looks at the parcel.</i>) Unless&mdash;unless&mdash;well&mdash;I
wonder now if I&mdash;</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Brown</span> <i>enter through yard door.</i> <span class="smcap">Brown</span>
<i>is carrying a bucket filled with washed potatoes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> There. Put it down there. You didn't know we
wanted that much, did you not? You're getting as big an
old liar as Mr.&mdash;(<i>She stops short on perceiving</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>looking up and then realising what had made
her pause</i>). Aye. Go on. As who do you say, woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>recovering herself</i>). Just as big an old liar as
Andy McMinn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Now, whist. The McMinns were aye decent
folk. (<i>He glances across at</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, <i>who apparently is
not listening.</i>) They're near people, and all that sort of
thing, but once they say a thing they stick to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> They're a lot of mean scrubs, the whole
caboosh of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>to himself</i>). I wonder would twenty pounds be
any use at all?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>nudging</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>slyly</i>). I believe that once Sarah
puts a price on a thing, like a pig or a sow, or a hen, the
divil himself couldn't beat her down in the price of it.
And Andy, they say, can beat the best dealer in the county
from here to the Mourne. (<span class="smcap">Daniel,</span> <i>who has been listening
uneasily, gets up and turns round to look at them.</i>) It's the
fine cigar that you were smoking, Mr. Daniel, this
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Cigar? Yes. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Aye. A fine cigar, sir. There was a grand
smell off it. I seen you coming up by the McMinns,
sir, this morning on the road from the station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes. On the road from the station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> You didn't see them, but I noticed Andy
and Sarah coming out to the gate when you had passed
them and looking after you a long time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span> Aye. A long time, sir. I suppose, like
myself, they smelled the cigar. (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>at once throws
down the cigar in disgust.</i>) Mr. Andy, they say, is guy
fond of a good cigar, and I understand that he'll be for
getting a few boxes of them soon, for the sister, they say,
is coming into a lot of money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Ach, you and your cigars! Will you get out
of this and quit tormenting people? Go on. Out you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> (<i>as if out of curiosity, picks up the cigar and
goes out slowly</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> He's a very impertinent man that. Very worrisome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Ach, never heed him, Mr. Dan! sure no one in
this house does. You'll be tired after travelling, sir.
Will I make you a drop of tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> It's hard to eat anything, Kate, when I'm
worried. (<i>Despairingly.</i>) I don't think there's another
man living that has the same worries as I have. Something
awful! Where's the pen and ink, I wonder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> There's some here on the dresser, Miss Mary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
was using it to-day. (<i>She takes it over from the dresser
to the table.</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>rises and goes over and sits down
and begins slowly to write.</i>) Cheer up, Mr. Daniel. Sure
you sold the plans of the bellows anyway. Didn't you,
sir? They had word up at the McAleenans the other
night that you got two thousand for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Eh? They said that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Aye. To be sure. McAndless told McArdle,
and he told Smith the postman, and the postman told the
McAleenans, and said he had seen letters about it. And
McAleenan was up in McMinns the other night and told
them, and I believe you never saw such an astonished
crowd of people in all their lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> He told the McMinns that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Aye, last night I think it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Last night? (<i>He looks at the letter.</i>) Yesterday
was the 14th, wasn't it? Aye. It was. I wonder
did they believe McAleenan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> I don't think they know right what to make of
it. And yon Scotchman was there at the time, and mind
you, Mr. Dan, they say he looked quite serious when he
heard it, and said such things as that happened many's a
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>incredulously</i>). Mackenzie said that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Aye. You know, I think it's maybe because
he has a wee notion of Miss Mary, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> It's quite possible. Quite possible. A nice
wee girl is Mary. Fact, too good for the half of the clodhoppers
about these parts. (<i>He takes up the parcel, pen,
and ink, and paper, and goes across into the workshop.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span> (<i>looking after him</i>). Poor creature. I'm feared
he's for the road again if he doesn't worry out some way
for himself. And God knows he's the one best fitted
for it. (<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>enters.</i>) Well, did you see him off comfortably?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Alick McCready.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Kate. I with you'd mind your own business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> It's a sore time I have in this house minding
my own and every other bodies' business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Kate. He said I couldn't bake a cake to save
my life. I'll just show him that I can, and you're not
to help me, mind you. I'm going to do it all myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Where's the flour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> There's none in the house, Miss Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> You mind it was all used up this morning on
account of them cakes that nearly killed your poor ould da.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Go down to McArdles, Kate, and get a quarter
stone on account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Your da told me this morning, Miss Mary,
that I wasn't to get any more from McArdles or any
other place unless he gives me an order for it. Do you
not mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>dejectedly</i>). So he did. I had forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Aye. Quite so, Miss. (<i>She sits down contentedly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I wonder is Uncle Dan about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Aye. He's in his workshop, Miss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (going over and knocking at door of workshop).
Uncle Dan!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>appearing at door</i>). Well, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Uncle Dan, could you give me sixpence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>jumbling in his pockets</i>). Sixpence? Sixpence,
Mary? Bless your wee heart. Here. Here's a two
shilling bit. But Mary, mum's the word. Don't tell
John I gave it to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No. Thank you, uncle. (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>goes in
again.</i>) There, Kate, quick as you can and don't stop
to talk to anybody. Sure you won't? (<i>She hands</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>
<i>the money and takes up the recipe book.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> I'm not dirty looking&mdash;am I, Miss Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>absorbed in the book</i>). No. You'll do grand.
Flour, currants.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Ach! You and your currants. Could you not
tell a body was her face clean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> It's lovely. Hurry, Kate. (<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>shrugs her
shoulders disgustedly, and goes out by yard door.</i>) Flour,
currants&mdash;&mdash;(<i>She goes over to the workshop door and listens</i>)&mdash;raisins&mdash;(<i>A
sound as of a blast blowing can be heard.</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>
<i>becomes intensely interested, and, throwing aside the book,
kneels down and puts her head to the keyhole.</i>) He's
actually got something to work. (<i>She peeps in.</i>) He
has, indeed. (<i>She laughs, knocks loudly at the door, and
then runs to the other side of the kitchen.</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>opens
the door and cautiously peeps out.</i>) Uncle Danny! Ha!
Ha! Uncle Danny! (<i>Dancing up and down in front
of the fireplace.</i>) Uncle Dan's a wonderful man! Uncle
Dan's a wonderful man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>amazed</i>). What's all this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I'm a cleverer girl than you think, Uncle Dan!
I know your great surprise. I've found it out. And
you've actually got it to work! That's splendid, uncle,
isn't it? Father will be awful proud when he hears
about it. And you did it all yourself, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well, I took those plans, Mary, to a handy chap,
an acquaintance of mine, and he made it out according
to my design. I'm not sure&mdash;I think it works all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> And did you get it sold, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. No, Mary, but I have hopes&mdash;great hopes.
(<i>He wanders up to the window apparently searching for the
screw driver.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Do you think you'd get more than one thousand
pounds for it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>looking out of window and seeing someone
approaching</i>). Don't know, Mary. Don't know. Very
hard to know these things. Where could that screw
driver be I wonder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I think I saw father working with it last at
something in the parlour. Will I get it for you, Uncle
Dan? (<i>Knocking at door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> No. Never mind, Mary. I'll get it myself.
There's someone at the door. You better open the door,
Mary. (<i>He goes off hurriedly to parlour.</i>) (<i>Knocking at
yard door.</i>) Come in. (<span class="smcap">Donal Mackenzie</span> <i>opens the
door and comes in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Fine afternoon, Miss Murray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>coldly</i>). Good day to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> I'm going off to Scotland verra soon, and
I thought I would call over to see you before I went off.
You're no angry, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No. (<span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> <i>seats himself at the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Did you get a post card?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I got some silly thing this morning that I tore up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> I'm sorry. I'm verra fond of you, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Miss Murray, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> A girl like you is lost here, you know.
Now, if you were a Scotch lassie you would have a great
time enjoying yourself. In a place like Greenock we
have a theatre, and we have a music hall and a cinematograph
show on Saturdays and trains to Glasgow. You
could have a grand time in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Do you really like me, Mr. Mackenzie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Verra much. Indeed I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Well. Look here. I would like you very,
very much too, if you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> If I what, bonnie Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I'd even let you call me Mary, and write to
me if you wanted to, if you would do me a favour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> What's the favour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Uncle Dan has brought home his fan bellows,
and it works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>laughs</i>). The fan bellows! I think he'll
never make much of a fortune of his fan bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Do you ever examine new inventions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Aye. I'm a specialist on that, you know.
I'm the writer of the inventions column in the
Scottish&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes. Yes. That's all right. I know. Are
all the inventions you write about good things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Eh? Ninety-nine per cent. rotten, lassie.
Ninety-nine per cent. perfectly rotten. People don't
invent a reciprocating piston that works every day in
the week, or a fan bellows either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But if you liked the inventor you could do him
a good turn all the same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Aye. I did that often.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Then could you do a good turn for Uncle Dan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Give the bellows a boost up. No, Mary.
I could nae. I don't like to grieve you, but committing
perjury&mdash;No. I couldn't do it, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>coming closer</i>). Yes. You would. You'd do
it for me. Won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Look. Uncle Dan has his new fan bellows
in that workshop. Go in and look at it, and if you do
like me really, you could tell the McMinns that it was
good&mdash;even if it wasn't quite perfect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). Um. I'll consider the
question.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>re-enters. He stops short on seeing</i> <span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span>,
<i>and seems to become very uncomfortable.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Uncle Dan! Mr. Mackenzie's going to
examine your bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I don't allow everybody to go and look at it.
No. I refuse. It's my property and no one else's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Uncle Dan. (<i>She looks at him meaningly.</i>)
Mr. Mackenzie has promised to give his opinion on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> It's not protected yet by patent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Andy McMinn is coming over, Mr.
Murray. He has got orders from his sister to settle the
case for her. Are you going to pay the money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> That is a matter of my own deciding. (<span class="smcap">Mary</span>
<i>goes over to her uncle and whispers to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Verra well. I may go. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mary.</span>) I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
would have done you that good turn, Miss Murray; but
there's no enmity between us. And (<i>lowering his voice</i>)&mdash;I
hope you get the best of the McMinns in the bargain.
Don't give in, Mr. Murray, easy. Take my tip. I'm
from the stables, you know. (<i>He laughs knowingly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Here's Andy now (<i>she looks out through the
window</i>), and Alick's with him. (<i>She opens the door,</i> <span class="smcap">Andy
McMinn</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">McCready</span> <i>enter.</i> <span class="smcap">McCready</span> <i>glances at</i>
<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span>, <i>and goes over sulkily to the fireplace.</i>
<span class="smcap">Andy</span> <i>advances awkwardly towards</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>genially</i>). Good afternoon, Andy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Good afternoon. (<i>He looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Mackenzie,</span>
<i>who nods curtly.</i>) I suppose you know I've power to settle
the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well, you wrote the letter, and so, in point
of law, I think it is you who should look after all this
unfortunate business. Believe me, Andy, I sympathise
with you. I do indeed. (<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> <i>become
absorbed in conversation near the table.</i> <span class="smcap">Alick McCready</span>
<i>stands at the fireplace looking at them and unable to conceal
his jealousy, makes sundry odd noises to distract</i> <span class="smcap">Mary's</span>
<i>attention. She pretends not to hear him.</i>) I have your
letter here. (<i>He searches in his pocket and produces it.</i>)
Yes. One thousand pounds. Do you not think that
a trifle high?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Well. You know we could have as easily
claimed two thousand, but we didn't like to break you
altogether; so we just said that a thousand would come
pretty near it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Mr. Daniel, may I look at the bellows?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Uncle Dan, I'm sure you won't object. (<i>She
makes a gesture as if asking him to assent.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>looking hard at her, and then seeming to understand
what she is about</i>). Yes. Yes. I'll thrash out the
matter here with Andy. (<span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> <i>goes across into the
workshop, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Mary.</span> <span class="smcap">McCready</span> <i>sits down
disconsolately at the fireplace and begins to smoke his pipe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
moodily.</i>) A thousand pounds is impossible. Absolutely
out of the question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McCready</span> (<i>to himself</i>). Ach. She only torments me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>looking over wonderingly</i>). Eh? People behave
strangely sometimes, Andy. Very strangely. (<span class="smcap">McCready</span>
<i>makes no response, but sits with his back to the two of them.</i>)
Just a moment, Andy. What about a wee drink. Eh,
Andy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Aye. Well, I wouldn't mind at all, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Just to show there's no ill-feeling over this
unfortunate business. (<i>He goes to the clock, opens the
panel door and takes out a bottle of whiskey, gets glasses
from the dresser and pours out a small portion of whiskey
into each.</i>) Good health, Andy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Good health, Daniel. (<i>They drink.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Now to go on with our business. I don't
think, in the first case, that this was an affaire de
coeur, as the Frenchmen say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> You don't understand French? Of course
not. No. It wasn't a love affair, I mean. I don't think
Sarah was in love with John, was she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). Well&mdash;indeed, now, I don't know
that she was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> No. We're all aware of that. He was just
what we'd call a likely man. That's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Aye. He would have been a good match for
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes. Quite so, Andy. He would have been
a good match for her. (<i>He makes notes in a pocket book.</i>)
Nothing like notes, Andy. Now, so much for the love
part of the business. They never exchanged letters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> No. No letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>writing</i>). No letters. Of course in a breach
of promise letters are a great help. A great help. I'm
very glad, however, just for your sister's sake, that she
never wrote any to John. Imagine them reading out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
love letters in the open court, and all the servant boys
gaping and laughing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> It's not nice, right enough. It's one thing I
wouldn't like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> No. It's one thing we would not like. Well.
No love. No letters. Next thing. He never courted her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Well, he came over and sat in the house a few
nights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes. No doubt. But hadn't he always
some message on business to transact with you? Loan
of a plough or a horse, or something like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). That's so, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Ah, yes. That's so, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> But I seen him with his arm round her the
night of the social at the school house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Andy. That's a wee failing of John's. I
often warned him about doing that sort of thing indiscriminately.
A bit of a ladies' man, John, in his way.
I saw him do the same nonsense four or five times that
night with other girls. John likes to think himself a
bit of a gay dog, you know. It's not right&mdash;I don't think
myself it's a bit proper to put your arm round a girl's
waist on every occasion, but sometimes it's quite allowable.
A night like a social, for instance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Aye. Of course a social's different.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Aye, Andy, a social's different. Well, now.
No love, no letters, no courting, no photographs
exchanged? (<i>He looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Andy</span> <i>inquiringly</i>). No photographs
exchanged? (<i>He notes it down.</i>) No ring?
In fact, Andy, no nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> But he proposed to her right enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Who said so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>astonished</i>). What? Do you mean to deny
he didn't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> My dear Andy, I don't know. There was no
one there but the two, I suppose, when he asked her&mdash;if
he did ask her. There's only her word for it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> He wouldn't deny it himself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well. That depends on whether he really asked
her to marry him of course. And it's likely enough
that John would be inclined to deny it if his memory was at
all bad&mdash;it is a bad memory he has, you know. He forgets
often to return your ploughs and that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>blankly</i>). Aye. He has a bad memory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes. Just so. And the fact that a verdict
of one thousand pounds would hang on it would hardly
make it any better. Would it? You've a bad case
against us, Andy. A rotten case! In fact, looking over
the whole thing carefully, do you really believe you'd
make even a ten pound note out of us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>despairingly</i>). I wish Sarah had come and settled
the case herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Ah, no. You've a better head, Andy, for
seeing the sensible side of a thing, far better. (<span class="smcap">Mary</span>
<i>comes out of the workshop smiling gaily.</i>) Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Uncle Dan, he's delighted with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> What with? The bellows?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes. Go in, Andy, till you see it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Is it true, Daniel, you were offered two
thousand for it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> We'll just go in and have a look at it. (<span class="smcap">Andy</span>
<i>and he go into workshop.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>looking across at</i> <span class="smcap">Alick</span>). What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Nothing. I'm going home. (<i>He goes across
to the yard door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Alick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McCready.</span> Goodbye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> And I was going to go to all the trouble of
baking a big plum cake for you, you big ungrateful thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McCready</span> (<i>stopping at the door</i>). I know what your
plum cakes would be like. (<i>He opens the door and stops
again before going out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Well, get that big, ugly Maggie Murphy to
bake them for you then.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">McCready</span> (<i>looking out through door and then coming
inside again</i>). I say, here's Kate and your father coming
and a load of flour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>in a frightened voice</i>). Kate and father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McCready.</span> He seems to be in a bit of a temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>in a frightened voice</i>). He's caught her with the
flour!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McCready</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Flour? Aye&mdash;she's carrying
about three stone of it! Boys, but that would make a
powerful pudding!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> It was to have been the nicest one I could
have baked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McCready</span> (<i>coming in and going over to her</i>). Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McCready.</span> You wouldn't come to my house where
there would be no stint of flour or raisins or anything
else, and I'd eat all you cooked for me no matter if I was
dying after it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Go to your house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alick.</span> Aye. Look here, wee girl. I got this&mdash;&mdash;(<i>He
fumbles and produces a ring.</i>) Let me put that on
your wee finger, won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, Alick, what a lovely wee ring. (<i>She allows
him to put it on her finger, and is shyly kissing him when</i>
<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>enters, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Kate,</span> <i>who is trying vainly to
stop a leak in the bag of flour which she is carrying.</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>
<i>goes to the dresser and places the bag on it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>severely to</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>). Mary. Did you send her
for more flour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>meekly</i>). Yes, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> And didn't I leave word there was no more to be
got without my orders? (<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>hangs her head.</i>) It's
lamentable the waste in this house! I was just looking at
the pass book last night, and you'd think this house was
a bakery to see the amount of flour comes into it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>submissively</i>). I'm sorry, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> When I was out on the road, I seen a trail of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
flour leading up our loaning, and says I to myself, Jeminy'
father, are they getting some more! So I followed up the
mark and just caught up on her coming through the gate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>a little defiantly</i>). It's paid for, Kate, anyway.
Isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> It is, Miss. (<i>She busies herself putting the flour
into a box, and then slips out during the next speech.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Eh? Who give you the money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>going over to her father and whispering</i>). Uncle
Dan is in there, father, with Andy McMinn and Mr.
Mackenzie, the Scotch engineer, looking at his bellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>amazed</i>). Eh? Andy McMinn? Is Dan
settling the case?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I believe he'll do it yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>admiringly</i>). He has a great head on him, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>coming out of workshop and going over
to</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>). Mary, I'm sorry. That bellows is such an
absolutely rotten thing&mdash;so useless and so absolutely
rotten that I can't&mdash;(<i>He sees</i> <span class="smcap">John.</span>) How are you, Mr.
Murray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Fine day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>appealingly</i>). Mr. Mackenzie, what did you say
to Andy about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> What did I say? Oh, ma perjured
conscience&mdash;I said it was a grand thing. (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Andy McMinn</span> <i>come in from workshop.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>nervously</i>). Brave day, John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye. It is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> Sarah gave me power to settle the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I'm glad to hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> I tell you what it is, Mr. Daniel Murray.
It's a good thing that&mdash;a right good thing, and I'll make
you an offer for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). What's it worth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>with a look at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>). It's worth&mdash;it's
worth more than all the damages your sister will get
from Mr. Murray.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>suddenly</i>). I tell you what it is, Andy, and
believe me when I tell you, I'm sacrificing a great deal.
I'll make a deal with you. Instead of a lump sum cash
down, I'll hand over all the rights and royalties of that
same bellows to you to settle the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>dubiously</i>). I&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> You will have all the expense of the law, the
bad name that your sister will be having over the head
of being in a breach of promise, and all the expenses of
solicitors and lawyers. Then, after that, trying to get
the money out of us, and, mind you, we will fight you
to the last ditch. Won't we, John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Aye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> There now. What do you say, Mr.
Mackenzie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> I tell you what it is, Mr. Murray. I'll
make you an offer for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy</span> (<i>hastily</i>). I'll take your offer, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> One second. I drew up a wee agreement
for you to sign, and I'll fetch the bellows. (<i>He goes into
the workshop.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> I don't like signing my name to agreements
or things like that unless I'm quite certain they're all
right, Mr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span> (<i>with a sly look at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>). Well, if you have
any compunction about signing, I'll do it myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I think Uncle Dan's a fool to throw away the
thing that way. I do indeed. (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>comes out with
the parcel and the pen, ink and paper.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Just sign your name to that, Andy. It's a
sort of agreement to settle the case&mdash;you can read it
for yourself. (<i>He hands a sheet of paper to</i> <span class="smcap">Andy</span> <i>with the
pen.</i>) It's to show that the whole thing is fixed up to
the satisfaction of everybody. (<span class="smcap">Andy</span> <i>looks at it and then
signs.</i>) Ah. Good! Now, Alick, and you, Mr.
Mackenzie, just witness it and the date. (<i>They both
sign.</i>) And now, Andy, there's your bellows. (<span class="smcap">Andy</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<i>looks at it, and then takes it under his arm.</i>) And may
you have the best of luck with it. (<span class="smcap">Andy</span> <i>looks wonderingly
at the parcel in his arms and moves slowly towards the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> Noo, my reward, Miss Murray&mdash;Mary
rather. (<i>He goes forward and she stretches out her hand for
him to shake, when he notices the ring, and stops short.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I hope you're satisfied, Andy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> I'm just wondering, Mr. Mackenzie, do you
think&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackenzie.</span> I think nothing for a year. I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'm
for Scotland in the morning. (<i>He goes out morosely
through the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> There, Andy. There's company home for
you, and good luck to you. It's a sad heart I'll have this
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andy.</span> I'm wondering what Sarah would say&mdash;(<i>He
goes to the door.</i>) Ach! She couldn't do better herself.
No courting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> No. No courting.</p>
